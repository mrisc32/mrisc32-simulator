# MRISC32 Simulator

This is a simple MRISC32 CPU simulator, written in C++. It can load and execute binaries generated by an MRISC32 assembler (see [Tools](../../tools/README.md)).

## Building

Use CMake and a C++ compiler to build the simulator:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake path/to/sim
cmake --build .
```

## Running

```bash
./mr32sim path/to/program.bin
```
